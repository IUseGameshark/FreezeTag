<h1> FreezeTag </h1>
<h3> Co-written By <a href="https://github.com/mitchell-lng">Mitchell Long</a> and <a href="https://github.com/IUseGameshark">Noah F.</a> </h3> 
<p>This is a reletively simple Minecraft server plugin for Spigot that's just a game of freeze tag. A few things are configurable, namely the game time and number of taggers. The taggers are chosen randomly, and the avoiders win when the timer ends and not everyone has been tagged, and the tagger(s) win when they tag every person before the game ends. </p>
<br>
<p>To start the game command use: <code>/freezetag start</code> and to stop it's <code>/freezetag stop</code></p>
<p> You can change the <code>FreezeTag.Resistance.Bypass</code> permission to have your players not get resistance on join (resistance is given so players don't die due to tagging) and <code>FreezeTag.StartStop</code> can be given to players you want to allow to start the game. By default all players get resistance and opped players can start and stop freezetag games. </p>
